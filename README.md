Coding in R Assignment 4 - Hasan Abdo
Cleaning Martians Data

This file will contain the rough plan of what I am trying to do within the midterm assignment.

Please keep in mind that this plan is written at the start, and I may not end up following it. 

Rough outline of steps each step to be done in a new branch (for clarity):

(1) EDA - exploratory data analysis 
(2) data cleaning - removing data and fixing any formats (like dates and times) potentially
(3) establish the highest volume hours on weekdays (rush hours)
(4) Determine the 10 most frequent starting stations and ending stations during the rush hours you established + Determine the 10 most frequent starting stations and ending stations during the weekends.
(5)Calculate the average utilization of bikes for each month (total time used/total time in month).
(6)creating a new data set combining trip data with the weather data.
